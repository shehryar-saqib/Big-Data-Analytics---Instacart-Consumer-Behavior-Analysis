# Instacart Consumer Behavior Analysis

Welcome to a practical, end-to-end analytics solution for unpacking Instacartâ€™s 2017 order data. This project will guide you from raw data to actionable insights.

## ðŸ”‘ Whatâ€™s Inside

* **Smart Data Engineering:** Scripts that automatically clean raw CSVs, impute missing values, and engineer features around purchase recency, frequency, and seasonality.
* **Insightful EDA:** Jupyter notebooks full of interactive charts and dashboards to reveal key ordering trends and product popularity.
* **Customer Segmentation:** RFM scoring paired with clustering (e.g., K-Means) to spotlight high-value customers and those who need re-engagement.
* **Next-Item Prediction:** A full modeling pipelineâ€”featuring gradient boosting and neural networksâ€”with evaluation metrics and cross-validation baked in.
* **Market Basket Analysis:** Apriori and FP-Growth implementations that surface high-confidence item associations for smarter cross-sell and bundle strategies.
